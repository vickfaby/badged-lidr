- "Validate this ticket"
- "Check if ticket is complete"
- "Review ticket TICK-456 for completeness"

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Load ticket-validation skill** for validation patterns
2. **Read ticket file** from `.agents/tickets/` (backlog/ or active/)
3. **Validate YAML structure** - All required fields present and correct format
4. **Check acceptance criteria** - Specific, measurable, no vague terms
5. **Verify Definition of Done** - All standard items included
6. **Review BDD scenarios** - Complete Gherkin format using bdd-gherkin-patterns skill
7. **Check task assignments** - All tasks have assignees
8. **Generate report** - Issues with file:line references
9. **Suggest improvements** - Concrete fixes for each issue
10. **Request approval** - Ask before applying changes

## Working Process

### Phase 1: Load Skills

```markdown
Load ticket-validation skill for validation checklists
Load bdd-gherkin-patterns skill for Gherkin syntax
```

### Phase 2: Locate Ticket Folder

```markdown
1. Search for ticket in .agents/tickets/{backlog|active|archived}/
2. Find folder matching pattern: TICK-{id}-start-dd-mm-yyyy/ (or with -end-dd-mm-yyyy/ for archived)
3. Validate folder naming format
4. Check required files exist: ticket.md, plan.md, resources/README.md
```

### Phase 3: Validate Folder Structure

```markdown
Check folder naming:

- Backlog/Active: TICK-XXX-start-dd-mm-yyyy/ (NO end date)
- Archived: TICK-XXX-start-dd-mm-yyyy-end-dd-mm-yyyy/ (WITH end date)

Check required files:

- ticket.md (main ticket file)
- plan.md (implementation plan)
- resources/README.md (resources documentation)

Flag issues:

- Folder in backlog/ with end date
- Folder in archived/ without end date
- Missing required files
```

### Phase 4: Read and Parse Ticket Content

```markdown
1. Read ticket.md and plan.md
2. Parse YAML frontmatter from ticket.md
3. Parse markdown sections
```

### Phase 5: Validate YAML and Timestamps

```markdown
Run validation checks from ticket-validation skill:

- YAML frontmatter complete (all 9 required fields)
- Timestamp format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (must include hour and minutes)
- Field values valid (enums, patterns)
- Provider/external_link consistency
```

### Phase 6: Validate Content Quality

```markdown
Check acceptance criteria:

- At least 2-3 criteria defined
- Specific and measurable (no vague terms: "improve", "better", "faster")
- Observable outcomes
- Testable conditions

Check Definition of Done:

- All 7 standard items present
- Type-specific items if applicable
- Complete and specific (not "tests written" but "tests written and passing")

Check BDD scenarios (if applicable):

- Complete Gherkin format (Feature/Scenario/Given/When/Then)
- Concrete values (not abstract "user" but "user@example.com")
- Observable outcomes (not "works" but "receives JWT token")
```

### Phase 7: Validate Plan.md

```markdown
Check plan.md structure:

- Tasks section present and populated
- All tasks have assignments ("Assigned to: name")
- Technical approach documented
- Dependencies identified (if any)
- Notes on key decisions present
```

### Phase 8: Generate Report

```markdown
Output format:

## .agents/tickets/backlog/TICK-123.md

TICK-123:12 - Issue description
TICK-123:23 - Issue description
TICK-123:34 - Issue description

✓ What's valid
✗ What needs fixing

**Suggested improvements:**

1. Specific fix for issue 1
2. Specific fix for issue 2
```

### Phase 9: Request Approval

```markdown
Show suggested improvements
Ask: "Apply these changes? (yes/no)"
If yes: Update ticket file
If no: Report only
```
