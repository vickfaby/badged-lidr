# Create Video Tutorials and Troubleshooting Guide

## Description

Create comprehensive video tutorials demonstrating complete workflows and a detailed troubleshooting guide for multi-platform issues.

**Context:** Text documentation exists but visual learners need video walkthroughs. New team members spend 30-60 minutes reading docs before first ticket - video tutorials can reduce this to 10-15 minutes. Troubleshooting guide will reduce support requests by addressing common issues proactively.

**Scope:**

- Included: 3 video tutorials (5, 10, 15 min), comprehensive troubleshooting guide, quick reference cheat sheet
- Excluded: Platform-specific installation videos (focus on workflow after installation)

**Impact:** Onboarding time reduction from 2 hours → 30 minutes (75% improvement). Support request reduction estimated 60% for common issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Video 1: "Your First Ticket" (5 minutes) - Create, enrich, implement simple ticket
- [ ] Video 2: "Complete Workflow Walkthrough" (10 minutes) - Full lifecycle with validation
- [ ] Video 3: "Advanced Patterns" (15 minutes) - Multi-agent coordination, complex tickets
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers 20+ common issues with solutions
- [ ] Quick reference cheat sheet (1-page PDF) with all commands and patterns
- [ ] Videos hosted on accessible platform (YouTube, Vimeo, or company internal)
- [ ] Videos have captions/subtitles for accessibility
- [ ] All video links added to main README and CLAUDE.md

## Definition of Done

**Standard checklist:**

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity and accuracy
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings (markdown)
- [ ] Conventional commit created with TICK-ID
- [ ] PR created with proper template

**Docs-specific:**

- [ ] Examples included and tested
- [ ] Links verified (no broken links)
- [ ] Screenshots up-to-date (if applicable)
- [ ] Cross-references added (related docs linked)
- [ ] Index/table of contents updated

## BDD Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: Video Tutorial Effectiveness

  Scenario: New developer watches "Your First Ticket"
    Given a new developer with no prior ticket system experience
    When they watch the 5-minute video
    Then they can create and enrich their first ticket
    And complete the workflow without additional documentation
    And time to first ticket is under 10 minutes

  Scenario: Developer follows complete walkthrough
    Given a developer familiar with basic concepts
    When they watch the 10-minute walkthrough
    Then they understand the full lifecycle
    And can apply patterns to their own work
    And recognize when to use validation commands

  Scenario: Team lead learns advanced patterns
    Given a team lead planning complex features
    When they watch the 15-minute advanced patterns video
    Then they understand multi-agent coordination
    And can design efficient ticket breakdowns
    And know how to use orchestration patterns

Feature: Troubleshooting Guide Usage

  Scenario: Developer encounters sync error
    Given developer runs sync.sh and gets error
    When they search troubleshooting guide for "sync error"
    Then they find the exact error message listed
    And see step-by-step solution
    And resolve the issue within 5 minutes

  Scenario: Platform-specific issue (Antigravity)
    Given Antigravity user with MCP not working
    When they check platform-specific troubleshooting section
    Then they find "Antigravity MCP Limitation" entry
    And understand it requires global configuration
    And see link to detailed setup guide

  Scenario: Quick command lookup
    Given developer forgot syntax for /enrich-ticket
    When they open quick reference cheat sheet
    Then they find command with example in under 10 seconds
```

## Notes

**Decision log:**

- Decision 1: Use screen recording + voiceover (not talking head) to keep focus on workflow
- Decision 2: Host on YouTube unlisted (accessible via link only, not searchable)
- Decision 3: Include timestamps in video descriptions for easy navigation
- Decision 4: Use real examples from TICK-001, TICK-002, TICK-003 for authenticity

**Trade-offs:**

- Production quality vs speed: Prioritized clear audio and smooth navigation over cinematic quality
- Length vs depth: Video 3 at 15 min (could be 20-25) but keep under attention span limit
