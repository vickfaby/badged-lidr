# ADR-002: Liveness Detection Architecture - Edge vs Cloud Processing

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-03-15
**Decision Makers**: R&D Lead, Platform Lead, Mobile Lead
**Consulted**: Algorithm Team, DevOps Team, Product Manager
**Informed**: Customer Success, Sales Engineering

## Context and Problem Statement

LIDR's Selphi liveness detection currently processes all verification requests in the cloud, requiring full image upload. As we expand into markets with poor connectivity and stricter data residency requirements, we need to evaluate alternative architectures:

**Current Issues:**

- **Latency**: 3-5 seconds in regions with poor connectivity
- **Data Privacy**: Customer concerns about biometric data leaving device
- **Bandwidth**: High data usage in mobile-first markets
- **Compliance**: New regulations requiring on-device processing
- **Offline Capability**: Zero functionality without internet connection

**Core Decision**: Should liveness detection processing move to the edge (on-device), remain in cloud, or adopt a hybrid approach?

## Decision Drivers

### Technical Drivers

- **Performance**: Target <1 second for liveness determination
- **Accuracy**: Maintain current EER (Equal Error Rate) <0.5%
- **Device Constraints**: Support devices with 2GB RAM, mid-tier CPU
- **Model Size**: Mobile app size impact <50MB additional
- **Battery Life**: Minimal impact on device battery consumption

### Business Drivers

- **Market Access**: Enable deployment in data-sensitive regions
- **Competitive Advantage**: Sub-second liveness detection
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduce cloud computing costs
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Better UX in low-connectivity scenarios
- **Regulatory Compliance**: On-device processing for privacy

### Risk Factors

- **Security**: Model theft and reverse engineering
- **Algorithm Updates**: Deploying model updates to devices
- **Device Fragmentation**: Android/iOS performance variations
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring consistent results across devices

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Full Cloud Processing (Status Quo)

**Description**: All liveness detection processed on cloud infrastructure

```yaml
Architecture:
  - Mobile captures image/video
  - Upload to cloud for processing
  - ML inference on GPU clusters
  - Return liveness score + confidence

  + Centralized logging and monitoring
  + No device resource constraints

Cons:
  - High latency (3-5s in poor network)
  - Privacy concerns with biometric upload
  - Requires internet connectivity
  - High bandwidth usage (2-5MB per verification)
  - Scaling costs with usage volume
```

### Option 2: Full Edge Processing

**Description**: Complete liveness detection on mobile device

```yaml
Architecture:

```

### Option 4: Adaptive Processing

**Description**: Dynamic selection based on device capability and network

```yaml
Architecture:
  - Device capability detection at runtime
  - Network quality assessment
  - Adaptive model selection (3 model sizes)
  - Intelligent cloud/edge routing

Pros: + Optimized for each device/scenario
  + Best possible performance everywhere
  + Future-proof architecture
  + Personalized user experience

Cons:
  - Highest complexity to implement
  - Multiple model variants to maintain
  - Complex device profiling logic

### Rationale

After extensive prototyping and analysis, the hybrid approach provides the optimal balance:

1. **Performance**: 85% of verifications complete in <500ms on-device
2. **Accuracy**: Maintains cloud-level accuracy through intelligent fallback
3. **Privacy**: Most sensitive data never leaves the device
4. **Cost**: 70% reduction in cloud processing costs
5. **Market Access**: Enables deployment in privacy-conscious markets

### Technical Implementation

```yaml
Edge Model Characteristics:

Routing Logic:
  def should_use_cloud(edge_result, device_metrics, image_quality):
      if edge_result.confidence < 0.7:
          return True
      if image_quality.blur_score > 0.8:
          return True
      if device_metrics.inference_time > 1000:  # ms
          return True
      if edge_result.presentation_attack_probability > 0.3:
          return True
      return False
```
