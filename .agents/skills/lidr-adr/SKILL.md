description: "Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in MADR format to document significant technical decisions with context, alternatives, trade-offs, and rationale. Domain-agnostic — works for any technology stack, architecture style, or industry vertical. Use for hard-to-reverse decisions, decisions affecting multiple teams, significant trade-off choices, extensively debated options. Essential when a technical decision needs to be preserved so future team members understand the why. Always use when choosing a database/framework/cloud provider, always use when a decision was debated and needs documentation to avoid re-debating. Do NOT use for trivial reversible decisions, decisions already in tech-stack rules, or temporary PoC decisions. Triggers on 'architecture decision', 'ADR', 'technical decision record', 'document decision', 'why did we choose', 'decision record', 'technical trade-off'. Output in English (MADR format). Audience: Tech Lead (creates ADRs), Developer (references decisions), new team members (understands context).

# Architecture Decision Record Generator

Phase: any (typically 5 — Development) | Language: English (MADR format) | Domain: Any

## Workflow

1. **Capture context** — Document the problem/need driving the decision and constraints in play
2. **Enumerate alternatives** — List minimum 2 options evaluated (research, PoCs, benchmarks)
3. **Apply decision drivers** — Map each driver (performance, cost, team expertise, NFRs) to options
4. **Record outcome** — State chosen option with 1-2 sentence rationale
5. **Document trade-offs** — List good, bad, and neutral consequences honestly
6. **Assign status** — Proposed (pending review) → Accepted (team agreed) or Superseded
7. **Store** — Save as `docs/adr/ADR-{NNN}-{decision-title}.md` with sequential number

## When to Create (at least 1 criterion met)

- Hard to reverse (DB choice, framework, cloud provider)
- Impacts multiple teams/components
- Has significant trade-offs (perf vs maintainability, consistency vs availability)
- Was extensively debated (document to avoid re-debating)
- Affects NFRs (security, performance, scalability)
- Involves money (buy vs build, licenses, SaaS contracts)
- Will be asked by newcomers ("Why did we use X instead of Y?")

## When NOT to Create

- Trivial reversible decisions (tabs vs spaces → linter config)
- Decisions already in `rules/tech-stack.md` (following existing rules)
- Temporary PoC decisions (document in PoC report instead)

## Input

| Input | Required | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Technical context / problem | ✅ | Discussion, RFC, Slack thread |
| Alternatives evaluated (min 2) | ✅ | Research, PoC, team experience |
| Decision (or proposal) | ✅ | Team consensus / Tech Lead |
| Supporting data | Desirable | Benchmarks, PoC results, vendor docs |
| Known constraints | Desirable | PRD-T, rules/tech-stack.md, budget |

## Output Location

Generated documents should be saved to: **`docs/adr/ADR-{NNN}-{decision-title}.md`**

Uses sequential numbering and follows MADR format for architecture decisions.

Example: `docs/adr/ADR-005-database-migration-strategy.md`

## Output Template

```markdown
# ADR-{NNN}: {Decision title — descriptive phrase}

## Metadata
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | ADR-{NNN} |
| **Date** | YYYY-MM-DD |
| **Status** | Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded by ADR-{XXX} |
| **Deciders** | [Names and roles] |
| **Technical Area** | [Architecture / Infrastructure / Security / Data / API / Frontend] |

## Context
[Why we need to make this decision. What forces are at play. What constraints exist.]

## Decision Drivers
- [Driver 1 — e.g., "Need to support 10K concurrent users"]
- [Driver 2 — e.g., "Team has experience with React"]
- [Driver 3 — e.g., "Budget limited to $X/month"]

## Considered Options
1. **[Option A]** — {brief description}
2. **[Option B]** — {brief description}
3. **[Option C]** — {brief description}

## Decision Outcome
**Chosen option: "[Option B]"** because {1-2 sentence justification}.

### Consequences
**Good:**
- [Positive consequence 1]
- [Positive consequence 2]

**Bad:**
- [Negative consequence / trade-off 1]
- [Accepted risk]

**Neutral:**
- [Implication that is neither positive nor negative]

## Pros and Cons of Options

### Option A: {name}
- ✅ {pro 1}
- ✅ {pro 2}
- ❌ {con 1}
- ❌ {con 2}

### Option B: {name} (chosen)
- ✅ {pro 1}
- ✅ {pro 2}
- ❌ {con 1}

### Option C: {name}
- ✅ {pro 1}
- ❌ {con 1}
- ❌ {con 2}

```

## Example Output

```markdown
# ADR-{NNN}: {{TECHNOLOGY_CHOICE}} for {{SYSTEM_COMPONENT}}

## Metadata
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | ADR-{NNN} |
| **Date** | {{DATE}} |
| **Status** | {{STATUS}} |
| **Deciders** | {{ROLE_A}}: {{NAME_A}}, {{ROLE_B}}: {{NAME_B}}, {{ROLE_C}}: {{NAME_C}} |
| **Technical Area** | {{TECHNICAL_AREA}} |

## Context
We need to choose {{TECHNOLOGY_TYPE}} for the new {{SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION}} that will be used across {{PLATFORM_SCOPE}}. Current system uses {{CURRENT_TECHNOLOGY}}, but we need {{IMPROVEMENT_REQUIREMENTS}} for {{BUSINESS_DRIVER}}.

## Decision Drivers
- Need to support {{PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENT}}
- Team has {{EXISTING_EXPERTISE}}
- Must integrate with {{EXISTING_SYSTEMS}}
- Timeline: {{PROJECT_TIMELINE}}
- Budget constraint: {{BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS}}
- Must meet {{COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS}}

## Considered Options
1. **{{OPTION_A}}** — {{OPTION_A_DESCRIPTION}}
2. **{{OPTION_B}}** — {{OPTION_B_DESCRIPTION}}
3. **{{OPTION_C}}** — {{OPTION_C_DESCRIPTION}}

## Decision Outcome
**Chosen option: "{{CHOSEN_OPTION}}"** because {{DECISION_RATIONALE}}.

### Consequences
**Good:**
- {{POSITIVE_CONSEQUENCE_1}}
- {{POSITIVE_CONSEQUENCE_2}}
- {{POSITIVE_CONSEQUENCE_3}}

**Bad:**
- {{NEGATIVE_CONSEQUENCE_1}}
- {{NEGATIVE_CONSEQUENCE_2}}

**Neutral:**
- {{NEUTRAL_CONSEQUENCE_1}}

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Script
This skill includes automated validation via `scripts/validate-examples.ts`:

```bash
# Validate skill examples and structure
npx tsx scripts/validate-examples.ts
```

**Validation includes:**
- Example completeness and correctness
- Architecture decision documentation compliance patterns
- Progressive disclosure adherence
- Resource organization standards

**When to use:**
- Before skill release/packaging
- In CI/CD pipeline (quality gates)
- After major example updates
- During skill maintenance cycles

**Integration with ecosystem:**
- Used by `/multi-agent-audit` for ecosystem validation
- Supports quality gates in SDLC workflow
- Provides consistent validation across all skills

## Key Rules

- **Arguments, not opinions**: "We chose X because benchmark showed 3x throughput" > "We chose X because it's better"
- **Honest trade-offs**: Every option has cons. Document them.
- **Status lifecycle**: Proposed → Accepted → (may become) Deprecated / Superseded
- **Numbering**: Sequential. Check existing ADRs in `docs/adrs/` for next number.
- **Superseding**: When replacing an ADR, set old one to "Superseded by ADR-{NNN}" and reference in new one.

## Resources

- **Related Skills**: `architecture-doc` (for broader architectural context), `tech-debt` (when decisions create technical debt)
- **Related Templates**: `docs/templates/adr.md` (empty ADR template for manual creation)
- **ADR Storage**: Store completed ADRs in `docs/adr/` directory with sequential numbering
