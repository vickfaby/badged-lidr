## Quality Assessment

### Document Quality Criteria

- **Completeness**: All required sections present
- **Currency**: Updated within last 60 days for active docs
- **Accuracy**: Technical details verified and correct
- **Accessibility**: Proper formatting and findable location

### Quality Issues Found

#### Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

1. **Performance Requirements (docs/nfrs/performance-reqs-v1.0.md)**
   - Issue: Last updated 60+ days ago, contains outdated load targets
   - Impact: Development team using stale performance criteria
   - Action: Update with current algorithm performance baselines

2. **Definition of Done (docs/process/definition-of-done.md)**
   - Issue: Missing security scan criteria
   - Impact: Security gaps in delivery process
   - Action: Add SAST/SCA requirements

#### High Priority Issues

1. **Deployment Guide (docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md)**
   - Issue: Missing biometric-specific deployment steps
   - Impact: Deployment errors in production
   - Action: Add algorithm deployment and validation steps

2. **Release Process (docs/process/release-process.md)**
   - Issue: No rollback procedures documented
   - Impact: Risk during production releases
   - Action: Document comprehensive rollback strategy

## Document Accessibility Analysis

### Well-Organized Directories

- ✅ `docs/architecture/` - Clear technical documentation
- ✅ `docs/requirements/` - Requirements well structured
- ✅ `tests/test-cases/` - QA documentation organized

### Improvement Needed

- ⚠️ `docs/process/` - Mixed content, needs reorganization
- ⚠️ `docs/business/` - Sparse, missing key documents
- ❌ `docs/operations/` - Missing entirely, need to create

## BMAD-Style Recommendations

### Documentation Workflow Enhancement

1. **Standardize Templates**: Create consistent document templates
2. **Automated Updates**: Link documentation updates to code changes
3. **Quality Gates**: Include documentation review in DoD
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure all documents findable via search

### Governance Framework

1. **Document Owners**: Assign clear ownership for each category
2. **Review Cycles**: Quarterly reviews for critical documents
3. **Version Control**: All documents in version control with change tracking
4. **Metrics**: Track documentation coverage and quality over time
