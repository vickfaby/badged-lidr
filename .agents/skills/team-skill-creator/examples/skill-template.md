## Customization Tips

### Frontmatter

**name:**
- Use lowercase, hyphens
- Be descriptive: `react-testing`, not `rt`
- Example: `database-queries`, `api-integration`

**description:**
- MUST use third person: "This skill should be used when..."
- MUST include trigger phrases: Exact words users would say
- Include 3-5 trigger phrases minimum
- Add context about skill capabilities
- Length: 1-3 sentences, ~50-150 words

**Example good description:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user needs to "test React components", "write React tests", "test hooks", "test async components", or "set up testing environment". Provides testing patterns, Jest/RTL templates, and test boilerplate generation for React component and hook testing.
````

### Body Structure

**Keep SKILL.md lean:**

- Target: 400-700 lines
- Maximum: 5,000 lines (but split earlier)

**Move details to references:**

- Detailed docs → `references/`
- Complex examples → `examples/`
- Executable code → `scripts/`
- Templates/assets → `assets/`

**Reference from SKILL.md:**

```markdown
For detailed schema documentation, see `references/schema.md`
For complete examples, see `examples/advanced-usage.md`
```

### Bundled Resources

**Only include what's necessary:**

- ✅ Scripts that would be rewritten repeatedly
- ✅ References needed while working
- ✅ Templates/assets used in output
- ❌ General documentation (already in training data)
- ❌ One-time use files

**Organize clearly:**

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/          (if needed)
│   └── utility.sh
├── references/       (if needed)
│   └── detailed-guide.md
├── assets/           (if needed)
│   └── template.tsx
└── examples/         (if needed)
    └── usage-examples.md
```

## Minimal Skill Example

For simple skills, you can use a minimal structure:

```markdown
---
